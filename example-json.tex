\chapter{Example input JSON file for the Amazon Picking Challenge} \label{app:json}
JSON is a file interchange format, with a similar application scope of
its well-known cousin, XML; like XML, it consists of a tree-like
structure, delimited by braces, forms a set of key-node pairs, is which each node can be
either a value (numerical, string, etc.), an array of nodes (delimited
by square brackets), or another JSON tree. In the
specifications of the Amazon Picking Challenge, it is used as the
\emph{only} input for the operating robot, in order to describe to it the
content of each known bin (under the \texttt{bin\_contents} subtree) and
the required objects to take, together with the ID of the bin from
which to take them (under the \pre{work\_order} array). Each element of
the set of possible objects is assigned a unique ID.

An example of JSON file follows.
