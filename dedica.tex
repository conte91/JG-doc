\epigraph{\textit{The Encyclopedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus
designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius
Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as ``Your Plastic Pal Who's
Fun to Be With''. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the
marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetic Corporation as ``a bunch
of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the
revolution comes''.}}{The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\\textsc{Douglas Adams}}
