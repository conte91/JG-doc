\section{Pose strategy computation via intersection's volumes}
After recognizing the objects which are present into the scene and having a
good pose estimation, the robot used for objects' picking must compute the best path
in which to travel in order to correctly grasp it. In this project, this task
is accomplished by simulating a set of predefined poses over each object before
gripping. As the goal of the project is grasping a \emph{set} of objects, a
good grasping strategy must be implemented too; this strategy is described in detail in
sec. \ref{sec:TODO}
